# Project Update Log

## [1.5.4] - 2026-06-22

### Deployment & Routing: IIS Rewrite Rule for Static Images Fix

#### ⚙️ Deployment & Configuration Changes
- **web.config** & **client/public/web.config**: Added `ReverseProxy_Image` rule to proxy `/image/` requests to the Node.js backend on port 3000. This fixes the issue where IIS returns `index.html` (SPA fallback) for the top-left logo assets (`logo_BMA.png` and `bmalogo2.jpg`) because they are not located in the static frontend `client/dist` directory. Also added `ReverseProxy_InternalAdmin` rule (with `/ocsc-circular/internal-admin` rewrite destination) to proxy `/internal-admin` to Node.js backend.
- **server/src/config/adminjs.ts** & **custom dashboard components**: Prefixed all `internal-admin` routes, endpoints, and custom page fetch calls with `/ocsc-circular` to support deployments where the site is hosted inside an IIS Virtual Application subdirectory. This prevents 404 errors during logins, redirects, and custom API fetches.
- **start-production.ps1/bat**, **restart-production.ps1/bat**, **stop-production.ps1/bat**: Created new production management scripts in the root directory to automate starting, restarting, and stopping both PM2 services and the IIS server easily on Windows Server. Also fixed a PowerShell encoding/parser error by replacing the non-ASCII checkmark character `✔` with `[OK]` to prevent errors on Windows Server system locales.

#### ✅ Verification
- Rebuilt public client locally to copy the updated `web.config` to the production `dist` directory.
- Created and tested helper scripts wrapper on the local environment structure.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-18

### Upgrade & UI Fixes: Zod v4 Upgrade & Centered Logo Layout Fix

#### 🎨 Frontend & UI Changes
- **client/src/pages/PublicPage.tsx** & **client-public/src/pages/PublicPage.tsx**: Refactored the header logo element structure. Replaced the flex container centered layout with a robust `relative` container and `absolute inset-0` img setup. This prevents flexbox layout stretching bugs in browsers when rendering large natural-width (`2500x2500` px) image files, ensuring the green BMA seal stays perfectly centered and fully circular without getting shifted or cut off.
- **client/src/components/admin/Sidebar.tsx** & **client-admin/src/components/admin/Sidebar.tsx**: Applied the same relative/absolute bounding layout to the sidebar logo container for layout consistency across admin panels.

#### ⚙️ Backend & Schema Changes
- **server/package.json**: Upgraded `zod` from `^3.25.76` to `^4.4.3` (stable major version).
- **server/src/routes/delegationRoutes.ts** & **server/src/routes/admin.ts**: Refactored string/number validation inputs. Replaced legacy/incompatible `{ required_error: '...' }` object properties with `{ message: '...' }` to conform to Zod v4 validation parameters and fix TypeScript compile errors.
- **styled-components / adminjs dependency hotfix**: Installed `react-is` in the server backend to fix dynamic bundle loading crashes within AdminJS.

#### ✅ Verification
- **Compilation**: Successfully compiled the Express API backend via `npm run build` with zero errors. All three Vite 8 / React 19 frontend apps (`client`, `client-admin`, and `client-public`) build and compile cleanly in under 300ms.
- **Unit Tests**: Executed and verified that all backend routing unit tests pass cleanly.
- **Browser & Runtime Validation**: Restarted PM2 services and captured browser screenshots. Verified that the header logo is rendered as a perfect full circle, and frontend search query routing to the backend parses correctly using the new Zod v4 validators.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-06-18

### PM2 Windows Startup Configuration Fix

#### ⚙️ Deployment & Script Changes
- **client/serve.js**: Updated `BASE_PATH` from `'/circular'` to `'/ocsc-circular'` to match the new system base path naming convention. Also implemented a **built-in native Node.js HTTP reverse proxy** to forward API `/ocsc-circular/api/`, Admin `/ocsc-circular/admin/`, and assets `/image/` & `/uploads/` to their respective ports. This allows the system to run fully standalone on port 5173 without any dependency on IIS ARR (Application Request Routing).
- **client-admin/server.mjs**: Added logic to strip the `/ocsc-circular/admin` path prefix from incoming URLs, allowing production static assets to resolve correctly.
- **ecosystem.config.js**: Reconfigured PM2 apps to run frontends in **Production Mode** using lightweight native Node scripts (`serve.js` and `server.mjs`) instead of launching memory-intensive Vite development servers.
- **deploy-iis.ps1**: Updated deployment workflow to build both the public frontend (`client`) and admin frontend (`client-admin`) sequentially.
- **start-circular.ps1**: Added dependency verification check for the `client-admin` directory before executing PM2.
- **client/.env.production**: Changed `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to `"/ocsc-circular"` to match the new system base path naming convention.
- **client-admin/.env.production**: Changed `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to `"/ocsc-circular"`.
- **client-public/.env.production**: Changed `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to `"/ocsc-circular"`.
- **client/public/web.config**: Added permanent IIS URL Rewrite web.config configuration in the public assets directory (automatically copies to dist on compilation, preventing deletion when Vite empties outDir).
- **client-admin/public/web.config**: Added permanent IIS URL Rewrite web.config configuration in the public assets directory.
- **docs/DEPLOYMENT.md**: Rewrote the frontend deployment guide to explain correct Windows PM2 execution syntax and how to start the system using production Node.js servers natively.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-18

### Diagnostics: Database Setup and Troubleshooting Script

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **diagnose_db.js**: Created a persistent database diagnostic and setup script in the `server` directory. This script runs on Windows Server 2019, connects to the configured database, automatically creates the `ocsc_circular` database if it is missing (resolving error 3D000), lists active tables to verify migration states, and provides specific firewall/service troubleshooting advice.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **client/vite.config.ts**: Added proxy configurations for `/api/*`, `/uploads/*`, and `/image/*` endpoints targeting the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Changed binding `host` from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` to allow external / LAN IP connections (such as accessing via `172.31.167.17`).
- **client-admin/vite.config.ts**: Added matching proxy configurations for `/api/*`, `/uploads/*`, and `/image/*` endpoints targeting `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Changed binding `host` from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` to allow external / LAN IP connections.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-17

### Feature: System Rename to OCSC Circular

#### 🌐 Global Changes
- **System Rename**: Fully renamed the system from "circular" to "ocsc-circular" to support future migration and alignment with the OCSC document standards.
- **API Endpoints**: Replaced all frontend and backend routing paths, API targets, and PM2 process names from `/circular/` to `/ocsc-circular/`.
- **Database Refactor**: Changed target database names across both Local (`ocsc_circular`) and Docker (`ocsc_circular_db`) environments.
- **Gateway Configuration**: Reconfigured Nginx and `proxy.mjs` gateways to properly handle and forward `/ocsc-circular/` requests.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-06-17

### Documentation: Windows Server Docker Deployment Guide

- **Deployment Guide**: Created `docs/windows_server_deployment_guide.md` saving the complete troubleshooting history and solutions for deploying this project on Windows Server 2019 native containers, including fixes for missing `docker-compose`, QuickEdit mode freezes, and strict `package-lock.json` lockfile sync errors during `npm ci`.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-06-17

### Infrastructure: Windows Containers Deployment Support

#### 🐳 Docker & Deployment Changes

- **Windows Containers Support**:
  - Created `docker-compose.windows.yml` to support deploying the entire stack on Windows Server 2019 without WSL, using native Windows containers.
  - Created `server/Dockerfile.windows`, compiling and running via `servercore:1809` to fully support Puppeteer and Chromium for automated data syncing without crashing on Windows containers.
  - Created `client-public/Dockerfile.windows` and `client-admin/Dockerfile.windows` using lightweight Node.js static servers (`server.mjs`) on Nanoserver, replacing `nginx:alpine` since Nginx lacks a native Nanoserver image.
  - Created `gateway/Dockerfile.windows` and `gateway/proxy.mjs`. Replaced Nginx with an Express/`http-proxy-middleware` solution to route `/circular/api`, `/circular/admin`, and static volumes natively on Windows Containers.
  - Reconfigured the architecture to use a **Native Windows PostgreSQL Database** on the host. Removed the `db` container from `docker-compose.windows.yml` and updated `.env.docker` to route connections via `host.docker.internal`.
  - Restored default builder shell to standard CMD (`SHELL ["cmd", "/S", "/C"]`) after installing Node.js in all `Dockerfile.windows` files, preventing PowerShell's `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` from crashing the build on `npm ci` warnings.
  - Synchronized `server/package-lock.json` to resolve lockfile mismatch errors during clean build setup.
  - Generated and added `gateway/package-lock.json` to enable clean installation of reverse proxy gateway dependencies using `npm ci`.
  - Migrated Stage 2 base images in `client-public/Dockerfile.windows`, `client-admin/Dockerfile.windows`, and `gateway/Dockerfile.windows` from `nanoserver:1809` to `servercore:1809` to resolve silent Node.js startup crashes (exit code 1) caused by missing Visual C++ Redistributable DLLs in the minimal Nanoserver environment.
  - Added fallback npm log redirection `|| (type "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_logs\*.log" & exit 1)` to all `npm ci` build steps in the `Dockerfile.windows` files, allowing easy inspection of raw installation errors directly within Portainer/Docker build logs.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-06-17

### Feature: Workflow & User Field Refinement, Docker Deploy Fix, and System Upload Preparation

#### 🐳 Docker & Deployment Changes

- **docker-compose.yml**:
  - Configured `env_file` paths (`.env` and `.env.docker`) as optional (`required: false`) using modern Docker Compose schema. This resolves deployment crashes on servers (e.g., Portainer stacks) where `.env.docker` is missing because it is ignored by Git, by allowing them to fall back to the stack-generated `.env` file or host environments.

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**:
  - Refined `/users` endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`) by optimizing position name and agency fallback lookups.
  - Removed deprecated or unused fields from user create/update body parameter validation and insertion.
- **workflowService.ts**:
  - Integrated parallel workflow logic into the main submission and rejection process flow (`submitTrackResult`, `delegateWithinTrack`, `rejectTrack`). This allows auto-updating state flags when executing parallel tracks.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **UserSection.tsx (client-admin)**:
  - Removed outdated or redundant inputs ("สังกัด / หน่วยงาน" and "ตำแหน่ง") from user form modals to improve layout spacing and reduce vertical clutter.
- **WorkflowInboxSection.tsx (client & client-admin)**:
  - Added support for `STAFF` users to edit and save details on active tasks.
  - Restricted the "ส่งงานกลับ" (Reject) button to prevent role conflicts for `STAFF` and `COORDINATOR` users.

### Docker Deployment & Optimization (2026-06-15)

#### ⚙️ Docker Changes

- **server/Dockerfile**: Optimized the production stage build script. Switched to `USER node` before running `npm install` and copied files using the `--chown=node:node` parameter to prevent a slow post-build recursive `chown -R` on thousands of NPM dependency files.
- **Docker Stack Control**: Built the images and started the services, and subsequently stopped and tore down the containers, networks, and resources (`docker compose down`) per the user's shutdown request.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-06-14

### Bug Fix: Resolved Missing Parallel Documents in Inbox (Shared Client Support)

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **DashboardPage.tsx (client)**: Added the `checkIsCurrentOwner` helper to resolve parallel assignments. Updated count calculations (inboxCount, actingCount, trackingCount) to handle parallel ownership where the primary document current owner ID is null.
- **WorkflowInboxSection.tsx (client)**: Added the `checkIsCurrentOwner` helper and replaced all direct `in_current_owner_id` comparisons with `checkIsCurrentOwner` across all tabs (myTasks, myProcessedTasks, myCreatedTasks, actingTasks). This matches the fix previously applied to `client-admin` to ensure users running the unified client frontend see their assigned parallel tasks.

### UI/UX: Hidden Manual Assignment Option When Automatic Route is Available

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowActionModal.tsx**: Hidden the "มอบหมายงาน / ส่งข้ามสายงาน" (Manual Assignment / Cross-Division Forward) block when an automatic hierarchical recipient (`autoUpAssignee`) is present. This eliminates unnecessary options and enforces strict, automated routing down the correct path.

### Bug Fix: Resolved Duplicate Staging Queue Items in Bot Findings (Auto-imported Detection)

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**: Updated the `GET /bot-findings` route to automatically check and update any `PENDING` bot findings to `IMPORTED` if a matching circular already exists in the `c_information` table (matching either by post URL or document number + year). This resolves the issue where circulars created manually or saved in an inconsistent draft state would remain stuck/visible in the Bot Findings queue.

### UI/UX & Workflow: Separated Single-Division Sequential Flow and Multi-Division Parallel Flow

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **workflowService.ts**: Separated the routing logic for `HR_DIRECTOR` (or acting delegate) distributing work. If **more than 1 division** (`assignedAgencies.length > 1`) is selected, it triggers parallel assignment (`useParallelAssign = true`). If **exactly 1 division** (`assignedAgencies.length === 1`) is selected, it uses sequential flow (`useParallelAssign = false`) and queries the corresponding `DIV_DIRECTOR` (or active delegate) to set as `autoUpAssignee`. This prevents showing the manual assignee dropdown in both cases and flows.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowActionModal.tsx**: Made the auto-forward routing label context-aware. If the next assignee's role is `'DIV_DIRECTOR'`, it renders `'ส่งต่อไปยัง ผอ.กอง:'` (Forward to Division Director) instead of `'เสนอเรื่องขึ้นไปที่:'` (Submit up to) for cleaner UX.

### UI/UX: Hidden File Delete Buttons in Circular Details Modal (View Mode)

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **CircularModal.tsx**: Hidden the "ลบไฟล์" (Delete file) buttons for both the "หนังสือเวียนสำนักงาน ก.พ." (Original circular PDF) and "เอกสารแนบท้าย" (Attachments) sections, and the "+ เพิ่มรายการไฟล์สิ่งที่ส่งมาด้วย" (Add attachment) button, when the modal is opened in read-only/view mode (`isView = true`).

### Bug Fix: Resolved PostgreSQL GROUP BY Error in User List Endpoint

#### 🗄️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**: Added `ag.ag_role` to the `GROUP BY` clause in `GET /users` endpoint query. This fixes the database compilation exception `column "ag.ag_role" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function` when retrieving user accounts list on the Admin Management dashboard.

### UI/UX: Stylized Assignee Name Layout in Workflow Action Modal

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowActionModal.tsx**: Wrapped the target assignee's name in the automatic up-routing display with styling to show the name on a new line, in a smaller (`text-xs`), thinner (`font-normal`), and gray (`text-slate-500`) style as requested by the user.

### Bug Fix: Fixed Validation Error During Parallel Assignment

#### ⚙️ Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowActionModal.tsx**: Fixed a bug where a validation error ("กรุณาเลือกผู้รับมอบหมาย/ผู้รับผิดชอบ") incorrectly blocked document forwarding during parallel assignment (`useParallelAssign = true`). The form submission logic now properly bypasses the single-user selection requirement for parallel forward actions.

#### 🗄️ Backend Changes

- **workflowService.ts**: Updated the `getNextAssignees` logic so that `useParallelAssign` is only triggered if the HR_DIRECTOR is sending the document to **more than 1 agency** (`assignedAgencies.length > 1`). If sent to a single agency, the workflow will now correctly proceed as a standard sequential flow (`forward`), allowing the user to select the specific action/assignee from the dropdown.

### Bug Fix: Fixed Parallel Assignment Visibility in Inbox

#### 🗄️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**: Updated the `GET /admin/dashboard` query to include `parallel_owner_ids` using a subquery on `c_parallel_assignments`. This ensures the frontend receives the list of all active owners for a parallel document.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowInboxSection.tsx**: Updated the task filtering logic to utilize a new `checkIsCurrentOwner` helper function. The inbox now correctly displays documents assigned via parallel assignment by matching the logged-in user's ID against the `parallel_owner_ids` list. This resolves the issue where documents sent out by HR_DIRECTOR disappeared instead of showing up in the DIV_DIRECTOR's inbox.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-07

### Removed Dynamic Workflow Builder System

#### 🗄️ Database Changes

- **Migration Script**: Removed dynamic workflow builder columns (`ag_template_id`, `pa_template_id`, `pa_active_node_id`, `in_template_id`, `in_active_node_id`) and completely dropped the `workflow_templates`, `workflow_nodes`, and `workflow_edges` tables as the system now relies entirely on the hierarchical workflow engine.

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **index.ts & workflowTemplateRoutes.ts**: Removed all API routes and imports associated with the dynamic node-based builder (`/api/admin/workflows`).
- **parallelWorkflowService.ts**: Removed dynamic template logic from the parallel assignment engine and fixed a runtime crash caused by querying the deleted `ag_template_id` column. The assignment now directly falls back to the active `DIV_DIRECTOR` or `HR_DIRECTOR` hierarchy logic. Additionally, fixed a major bug where the system could not find the `DIV_DIRECTOR` because they were assigned to a child "POSITION" agency (e.g. `ag_id=48` inside `ag_id=2`), and the query failed to account for `parent_ag_id`. Also fixed `a_status` matching (from `'active'` to `'1'`).

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **App.tsx & Sidebar.tsx**: Removed the builder page from the client router and navigation menu.
- **Components**: Deleted `WorkflowBuilderPage.tsx` and `WorkflowBuilder.tsx` components to clean up the codebase.
- **AgencyFormModal.tsx**: Removed the "กระบวนการทำงานหลัก (Workflow Template)" dropdown field as the system no longer supports custom workflow bindings per agency.
- **WorkflowInboxSection.tsx**: Fixed a critical workflow sequence bug where COORDINATORs were incorrectly bypassing the internal approval chain and distributing work directly to external agencies. The button for COORDINATOR is now strictly "เสนอหัวหน้ากลุ่ม" (submit to GRP_LEADER). The "กระจายงาน" (Parallel Assign) button has been rightfully shifted to the HR_DIRECTOR, who executes the distribution after internal approval.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-07

### Refactored Workflow Processing to Match Real-World Procedures

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **workflow.ts**: Added `'PENDING_CLOSE'` status to the `WorkflowStatus` type union.
- **workflowRoutes.ts**: Changed role check for `/parallel-assign` to allow both `COORDINATOR` and `HR_DIRECTOR` roles. Added POST `/close` route to close workflows in `'PENDING_CLOSE'` status.
- **workflowService.ts**: Modified the `approve` method to set document status to `'PENDING_CLOSE'` instead of `'COMPLETED'` when approving to the `COORDINATOR`. Added the `closeWorkflow` method.
- **parallelWorkflowService.ts**: Modified `checkAndAdvance` to route the document to the active `HR_DIRECTOR` (or their level-1 acting delegate) in `'PENDING_HR_APPROVAL'` status when all parallel tracks are finished, instead of completing it directly.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **ParallelAssignModal.tsx**: Added `preSelectedAgencies` prop and auto-populated the modal tracks when opened.
- **WorkflowInboxSection.tsx**: Enabled `HR_DIRECTOR` to trigger the parallel tracks modal. Added the "Close Work" (ปิดงาน) button for the `COORDINATOR` when document status is `'PENDING_CLOSE'`. Passed `preSelectedAgencies` to `ParallelAssignModal`. Added `sweetalert2` import and `'PENDING_CLOSE'` badge style mapping.
- **apiService.ts**: Added `closeWorkflow` method to `workflowApi`.
- **WorkflowActionModal.tsx**: Fixed a bug where parallel-specific APIs (`parallelDelegate`, `parallelSubmit`, and `parallelReject`) were not called when `paId` was defined. Skipped user selector and validation for parallel rejections.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Feature: Position System & Account Role Refactoring

#### 🗄️ Database Changes

- **Migration Script**: Added `ag_type` (VARCHAR) and `ag_role` (VARCHAR) to `c_agency` table to support creating Positions directly inside the organizational hierarchy.

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**: Updated agency CRUD endpoints to handle `ag_type` and `ag_role`.
- **admin.ts**: Refactored user creation/update. System roles (`a_role`) are now automatically calculated. If `a_permiss` is admin/superadmin, the role is forced to `SYSTEM_ADMIN`. Otherwise, it inherits `ag_role` from the user's assigned position (defaulting to `STAFF`).
- **admin.ts**: Added a new endpoint `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/agency` to allow assigning users to positions or agencies via the organization chart.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **AgencyFormModal.tsx**: Added toggles to specify if a new hierarchy node is a "ส่วนราชการ (Agency)" or a "ตำแหน่ง (Position)", allowing assignment of position-specific workflow roles.
- **AgencyTreeSection.tsx**: Visually differentiated position nodes using teal badges, ID card icons, and rendered their system role tags directly in the tree.
- **AgencyMembersDrawer.tsx**: Implemented an "Attach Account" dropdown to easily pull unassigned users into a specific position, and a "Detach" button to remove them.
- **UserSection.tsx**: Removed the manual "Workflow Role" dropdown from the User form since roles are now governed by the Position System. Added an informational banner explaining the new inheritance rule.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **Network Error & CORS Rate Limiting**: Fixed a CORS bug where rate limiter blocks (429 responses) lacked the necessary CORS headers, causing browsers to reject them as a "Network Error". Moved the CORS middleware registration in `server/src/index.ts` to be initialized before the rate limiters.
- **API Rate Limits**: Increased the standard API rate limiter (`apiLimiter`) maximum allowed requests from 200 to 2000 per 15 minutes to prevent local development and rapid testing from triggering rate limit blocks.
- **Workflow Template Routes Exports**: Re-ordered code structure in `server/src/routes/workflowTemplateRoutes.ts` to place `export default router;` at the absolute end of the file for consistency and robustness.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Workflow Architecture Documentation**: บันทึกสถาปัตยกรรมการออกแบบกระบวนการทำงานแบบย่อยและไดนามิก (Modular & Dynamic Workflow Design) เป็นภาษาไทยไว้ที่ [workflow_modular_design.md](file:///e:/BMA_OCSC_Circular/docs/workflow_modular_design.md) เพื่อใช้อ้างอิงแนวทางออกแบบเชิงระบบของ BMA OCSC Circular

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Workflow Builder Update Bug**: แก้ไขบัคตอนบันทึก Workflow Template เดิมที่เกิด Error 409 (Conflict) โดยเพิ่ม API endpoint `PUT /api/admin/workflows/templates/:id` สำหรับการแก้ไข (Update) Template เดิมแทนการสร้างใหม่ทั้งหมด ทำให้สามารถบันทึกการแก้ไขได้อย่างถูกต้อง

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-05

### Feature: Admin Sidebar Workflow Builder Link & Connection Actions Configuration

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Sidebar.tsx**:
  - Imported `Link` from `react-router-dom` and added a `navLinkItem` helper.
  - Added "ตั้งค่าขั้นตอนการทำงาน (Workflow)" menu item under the "จัดการระบบ" (Manage System) section.
  - Restricted access to the workflow builder link to `superadmin`/`admin` (`isSuperAdmin`) roles.
- **WorkflowBuilderPage.tsx**:
  - Imported `Link` from `react-router-dom` and added a back arrow button to return to `/dashboard`.
- **WorkflowBuilder.tsx**:
  - Enabled action specification (มอบหมาย, เสนอ, ส่งต่อ, and custom label) on connection paths (edges) in the property sidebar.
  - Configured custom text styling and dark-mode background labels for React Flow edges.
  - Added an **"Outgoing Connection Creator"** panel inside the Node Properties sidebar to let users select a target node and action, then connect them via a button click.
  - Enabled deleting edges and nodes directly from the sidebar.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-04

### Feature: Workflow Builder Acting Delegation Integration

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowBuilder.tsx**: Integrated "Situational Awareness" UI for Acting Roles. When a user clicks a node assigned to a `ROLE` (e.g. `HR_DIRECTOR`), the right sidebar fetches and displays a real-time list of personnel currently acting in that role.
- **WorkflowBuilder.tsx**: Added a shortcut button "ตั้งค่า ➕" that links directly to `/circular/admin/dashboard/users` for seamless delegation management without breaking the Template workflow.
- **workflowEngineApi.ts**: Added `getActiveDelegationsByRole` method to fetch active acting personnel.

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **delegationRoutes.ts**: Created `GET /api/admin/delegations/active-by-role/:role` endpoint to fetch active delegations filtered by `delegated_role`.
- **Build & PM2**: Re-compiled TS backend (`npm run build`) and restarted PM2 instance (`circular-api`) to apply route changes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Feature: Dynamic Workflow Engine Implementation & Architecture

#### 🗄️ Database Changes

- **Migration Script**: Altered `c_workflow_inbox` via `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` to safely migrate the existing legacy table without losing data.
- **Workflow Engine Schema**: Added and ensured tables for `workflow_templates`, `workflow_nodes`, and `workflow_edges` for a dynamic node-based approval engine.
- **Template Seeding**: Created and executed `seed_workflow.cjs` to seed the default "OCSC Circular Workflow (Standard)" template (U-Shape flow with 10 steps).

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **workflowTemplateRoutes.ts**: Implemented full REST API CRUD for managing workflow templates, nodes, and edges (`/api/admin/workflows/templates`).
- **Circular Approval Endpoint**: Created `/api/admin/workflows/circular/approve` supporting both `SELF` and `ACTING` contexts, safely verifying active delegations.
- **index.ts**: Mounted the new `workflowTemplateRoutes` under `/api/admin/workflows`.
- **Build & PM2**: Successfully built the TypeScript backend (`npm run build`) and restarted the `circular-api` PM2 instance to register the new routes.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowBuilderPage.tsx**: Connected the Workflow Builder React Flow UI to the new backend API endpoints (`listTemplates`, `createTemplate`, etc.).
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced `loadTemplates` function to explicitly catch and display loading errors in the UI, replacing silent failures.
- **Vite Configuration**: Updated proxy configuration in `client/vite.config.ts` to correctly route `/circular/admin/.*` to `http://127.0.0.1:5175`.
- **IPv4 Binding**: Enforced `host: '127.0.0.1'` inside `client-admin/vite.config.ts` to fix IPv4/IPv6 mismatches causing `ECONNREFUSED` 500 HTTP Proxy Errors.

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend (Admin & Client) build: **Passed**
- API Endpoints: Verified 401 Unauthorized returns correctly when accessed without token.
- PM2 Status: **circular-api restarted and fully online.**

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-27

### Bug Fix: Resolved 'err' is of type 'unknown' in test_login.ts

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **test_login.ts**:
  - Resolved TypeScript compile error `"err is of type 'unknown'"` inside the `testLogin()` catch block by safely narrowing the error type using `axios.isAxiosError(err)`.

#### ✅ Verification

- Backend compilation (`tsc`): **Passed with 0 errors**

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-26

### UI/UX & Workflow: Reordered Circular Modal Fields, Resolution Options, and Task Submission Updates

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **CircularModal.tsx & WorkflowActionModal.tsx & WorkflowHistoryModal.tsx (React Portals Bug Fix)**:
  - Imported and integrated **React Portals (`createPortal`)** to render all three workflow/circular modals directly to `document.body` instead of inline within nested components.
  - Set the outermost overlay container `z-index` to `z-[9999]` to guarantee it sits at the absolute top of the global viewport stacking context.
  - **Resolution**: Completely resolved a classic browser compositing and stacking context bug (especially in Chromium browsers) where overlapping `backdrop-filter` layers (specifically the sticky, blurred header with `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md`) would render on top of the modal's dark overlay as a white/translucent horizontal strip.
- **CircularModal.tsx (Layout)**:
  - Moved the **"อ้างอิงหนังสือเวียน" (Circular Reference)** selection field so it renders immediately below the **"ชื่อเรื่อง" (Subject)** textarea in both standard edit and task-submission modes.
  - Swapped the vertical ordering of the **"มติคณะทำงาน" (Working Group Resolution)** and **"มติ ก.ก." (Committee Resolution)** dropdown selection inputs, displaying "มติคณะทำงาน" before "มติ ก.ก.".
  - Supported dual-mode functionality (`mode="edit"` and `mode="task-submit"`), filtering out administrative resolution/status inputs in task submission mode.
- **WorkflowInboxSection.tsx**:
  - Integrated the Pencil button for `COORDINATOR` users to edit and submit DRAFT status task workflow records.
  - Handled on-demand loading of active `HR_Director` users dynamically.
  - Re-used the modular `CircularModal` inside the task submit flow.
- **WorkflowHistoryModal.tsx**:
  - Rendered embedded user name and position snapshots in the workflow status log history.
- **apiService.ts**:
  - Added frontend support for active user lookup via workflow roles.

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**:
  - Created backend user lookup route `GET /users/by-role` restricting the output to active administrative users matching the designated workspace roles (e.g. `HR_Director`).
- **workflowService.ts**:
  - Embedded name and official position snapshots into history records when submitting workflow tasks.

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend compile and build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-25

### RBAC: Coordinator and Staff Menu Access Configuration & Login Context Fix

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Sidebar.tsx**:
  - Updated to receive the user's `role` prop from the authenticated session.
  - Allowed users with the `COORDINATOR` and `STAFF` roles to view and access the **"หนังสือเวียน" (Circular Documents)** menu in addition to SuperAdmins.
  - Allowed users with the `COORDINATOR` role (but **NOT** `STAFF`) to view and access the **"คิวงานบอต" (Bot Queue)** menu in addition to SuperAdmins.
  - **HOTFIX**: Explicitly allowed `SYSTEM_ADMIN` role to see both the "Circular Documents" and "Bot Queue" menus in the Sidebar, ensuring they aren't hidden if their security level is just User.
  - Implemented a dynamic rose-colored numerical notification badge next to the **"กล่องข้อความงาน" (Workflow Inbox)** menu item, displaying the count of pending active tasks when `inboxCount > 0`.
  - Updated the **"กล่องข้อความงาน" (Workflow Inbox)** icon from a generic tray (`bx-inbox`) to a highly professional checklist/task sheet icon (`bx-task`) in both the Sidebar and the section header.
- **CircularSection.tsx**:
  - Restricted visibility of the **"ตรวจสอบหนังสือเวียน (Bot)" (Check Bot Findings)** and **"เพิ่มหนังสือเวียนใหม่" (Add New Circular)** buttons so that they are only visible to users with the `SYSTEM_ADMIN` or `COORDINATOR` roles across all security levels.
- **ProfileModal.tsx**:
  - Fixed a state desynchronization bug where updating the `role` in the profile modal did not immediately update the `AuthContext` or `localStorage`. The application now calls `login()` directly after saving the profile so UI access restrictions (like button visibilities) update instantly without requiring a re-login.
- **DashboardPage.tsx**:
  - Passed the `admin?.role` prop into the `<Sidebar />` component.
  - Dynamically initialized `activeSection` state based on the logged-in user's permission level. If the user's security level is not Admin (`permiss !== 'superadmin' && permiss !== 'admin'`), the default landing page upon entering the system is set to **"หนังสือเวียน" (Circular Documents)** instead of "ภาพรวมระบบ" (Dashboard Overview).
  - Calculated `pendingTasksCount` (number of active workflow tasks assigned to the logged-in user) and passed it to the `Sidebar` as `inboxCount`.
- **AuthContext.tsx & LoginPage.tsx**:
  - Fixed a critical bug where the user's Workflow `role` field was not extracted from the login API response and not persisted in `localStorage` or loaded into the active React `admin` state. This was causing users like `admincsc01` (Security level `user`, Role `COORDINATOR`) to have `role` as `undefined` in their session, hiding the Circular Documents and Bot Queue menus.
  - Now correctly saves `admin_role` to `localStorage` on login and loads it upon context initialization.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-17

### UI/UX: Label Update in Public Search Page

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **ResultCards.tsx & ResultTable.tsx**: Renamed the field label "เหตุผลจากส่วนราชการ" (Reason from Agencies) to "**การพิจารณาจากส่วนราชการ**" (Consideration from Government Agencies) to maintain terminology consistency across the entire application (both Admin and Public interfaces).

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-17

### Feature: Added "Circular Details" Field

#### 🗄️ Database Changes

- **Schema Migration**: Added a new column in_circular_detail (TEXT) to the c_information table.

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **Admin API**: Updated /admin/dashboard, /admin/circular/create, and /admin/circular/update routes to support the new field.
- **Public API**: Updated /api/search and /api/circular/:id routes to include in_circular_detail in the response.

- **ResultCards.tsx & ResultTable.tsx**: Displaying the "**รายละเอียดของหนังสือเวียน**" field in the public search results.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-17

### Bug Fix: Circular Sorting Logic

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **Sorting Refactor**: Updated ORDER BY logic in both /api/search (Public) and /admin/dashboard (Admin) routes.
- **Chronological Order**: Changed from in_ordering DESC to c_year.year_value DESC, c_information.in_id DESC.
- **Resolution**: This ensures that newer circulars (e.g., year 2568) are always displayed before older ones (e.g., year 2553), fixing the issue where older records appeared first after clicking StatCards.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-17

### Bug Fix: Robust Circular Sorting (Newest First)

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **SQL Update**: Re-verified and ensured ORDER BY c_year.year_value DESC, c_information.in_id DESC is applied in both Admin Dashboard and Public Search routes.
- **Process Restart**: Restarted all PM2 services to ensure backend changes are active.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Defensive Sorting**: Added explicit frontend sorting logic in CircularSection.tsx (Admin) and PublicPage.tsx (Public) as a fallback mechanism.
- **Sorting Logic**: Circulars are now explicitly sorted by year_value (DESC) then in_id (DESC) before rendering, guaranteeing newest documents appear first regardless of API response order.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-05-17

### System: Database Integrity Check

#### 📊 Database Audit

- **Connection**: Verified successful connection to PostgreSQL database "circular".
- **Table Integrity**: Confirmed all core tables exist (c_information, c_year, admin, etc.).
- **Data Distribution**: Confirmed 416 circulars, with the largest volume in 2568 (38) and 2566 (26).
- **Sorting Validation**: Confirmed year_value in c_year is stored as a 4-digit string (e.g., '2569'), which correctly supports chronological sorting.
- **Encoding Note**: Observed sample data character set needs verification on specific terminal environments, but database structure is intact.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-17

### Bug Fix: SQL Aggregation Error on Sorting

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **SQL Query Optimization**: Added `c_year.year_value` to the `GROUP BY` clauses in both `/api/search` (Public, `public.ts`) and `/admin/dashboard` (Admin, `admin.ts`) queries.
- **Aggregation Error Resolution**: Fixed the PostgreSQL error `column "c_year.year_value" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function` which was introduced in [1.0.7] and [1.0.8] due to ordering by a column not present in the `GROUP BY` clause.
- **System Stability**: Fully restored data loading across both the Public Search portal and the Admin Dashboard.

#### ✅ Verification

- Public `/api/stats` and `/api/search`: **Functional & Verified (Returns 416 circulars with 200 OK status)**
- Admin `/admin/dashboard` Query: **Functional**
- PM2 Status: **Online (Both circular-api and circular-frontend restarted and verified)**

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-17

Swapped the "**รายละเอียดของหนังสือเวียน**" (Circular Detail) and "**การพิจารณาจากส่วนราชการ**" (Agency Consideration) fields, so that the Circular Detail is displayed first, matching the structural hierarchy of the administrative entry modal.

#### ✅ Verification

- Public Result Table: **Verified (Circular Detail row is shown before Agency Consideration)**
- Public Result Cards: **Verified (Circular Detail row is shown before Agency Consideration)**

## [1.1.2] - 2026-05-17

### Bug Fix: Resolved File Upload "Internal Server Error" and Modernized PDF Extraction

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **ES Module Import Compatibility (`aiService.ts`)**: Migrated the `pdf-parse` text extraction service to use the modern, type-safe ESM `PDFParse` class from the `pdf-parse` library (v2.4.5) instead of the legacy non-exported CommonJS default export subpath. This completely resolves the Node.js native ESM startup crash (`ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`).
- **Memory Optimization (`aiService.ts`)**: Added explicit `.destroy()` cleanup calls after PDF text extraction to completely free up resources and prevent memory or worker leaks in production.
- **Robust Syntax & Build Restoration (`admin.ts`)**: Resolved several critical TypeScript build and syntax compilation errors in `/admin` routes including duplicate block-scoped variable declarations, missing AI import references, and type helpers.
- **Production Secret & Logging Safeguards (`index.ts`)**: Securely encapsulated backend global exception handlers to log detailed traces on the server while keeping client-facing HTTP 500 error responses completely clean and trace-free.

#### ⚙️ Integration & System Verification

- **Programmatic File Upload Integration Test**: Created and successfully executed a multipart/form-data API integration test verifying that PDF files are successfully parsed via Multer and saved into the database, resolving the "Internal Server Error" issue report.
- **Build Status**: Verified that `npm run build` completes successfully inside the `server` directory with **0 errors**.
- **PM2 Services**: Restarted PM2 `circular-api` and verified it maintains an active, stable `online` status.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-05-17

### Feature: Added Quick View/Download Buttons for Uploaded PDFs & Locked Re-uploading Constraint

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Absolute Backend Link Resolving (`apiService.ts` & Result components)**: Exported the backend `BASE_URL` and prefixed it to the dynamic `/uploads/...` file requests in `ResultTable.tsx` and `ResultCards.tsx`. This successfully resolves the issue where uploaded PDF files could not be viewed/downloaded because the React app served at port 5173 was trying to resolve them locally instead of fetching from the backend server at port 3000.
- **Main List Direct Download Buttons**: Introduced custom inline buttons directly inside both the Public Search table row under the title and within the grid search cards. Users can now instantly view the original OCSC circular, attachments, or specific Mati files with a single click without having to expand the circular rows/cards first.
- **Safe File Upload "Delete-First" Constraint (`CircularModal.tsx`)**: Refactored the file input panels for "Original OCSC Circular File" and "Attachment File" inside the admin creation/edit modal. When a file is already uploaded, the file picker is completely locked and replaced by a gorgeous green alert badge displaying the uploaded filename and a "ลบไฟล์" (Delete File) button with a confirmation modal. The user must explicitly confirm and delete the existing file before they can pick and upload a new one.

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend Build: **Verified & Compiled (Passed 100% with 0 errors via Vite)**
- PM2 Service Status: **Restarted and confirmed active online**

## [1.1.4] - 2026-05-17

### Hotfix: Resolved Hybrid UTF-16 LE Encoding Issue Blocking Gemini AI Summary

#### ⚙️ Configuration & Environment Changes

- **Mixed-Encoding Recovery (`server/.env`)**: Discovered that the `server/.env` file was in a hybrid state where lines 1-32 were standard UTF-8 (ASCII), but the appended line containing `GEMINI_API_KEY` was written in **UTF-16 LE** (with null bytes `0x00` between every character). When `dotenv` read the file in UTF-8, it loaded `GEMINI_API_KEY` with spaces/nulls, resulting in an `undefined` configuration and causing all AI summarization calls to fail.
- **Clean UTF-8 Normalization**: Wrote and executed an automated Node.js recovery script to strip all null bytes (`0x00`) from the environment configuration, successfully converting the hybrid file into a clean, unified, industry-standard **UTF-8** file.
- **PM2 Service Reload**: Restarted backend API services in PM2. The correct, clean `GEMINI_API_KEY` is now fully loaded into memory and operational.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-05-17

### Hotfix: Migrated AI Service to flagship gemini-2.5-flash Model

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **API Model String Alignment (`aiService.ts`)**: Replaced the outdated `"gemini-1.5-flash"` string with the newly supported and active flagship model `"gemini-2.5-flash"`. This directly resolves the Google AI API `404 Not Found (models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta)` error that occurred because Google has phased out the older model identifier for this specific API region/version.
- **Live Connection Verification**: Successfully executed live connection test generating high-speed response with standard Thai text in 2 seconds.
- **PM2 Service Status**: Confirmed active online.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-05-17

### Feature: Unified Port 3000 and "หนังสือเวียนต้นฉบับ" Labels for all Uploaded PDF Links

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Port 3000 Routing & Link Verification (`CircularSection.tsx`, `ResultTable.tsx`, `ResultCards.tsx`)**: Replaced all remaining relative or mismatched `/uploads/...` links with `${BASE_URL}/uploads/...` utilizing port `3000`. This guarantees that both the admin list table and public search results fetch uploaded documents directly from the Express API server rather than seeking them locally.
- **Label Unification**: Updated all button/link labels for both original circulars and attachments across all screens to say `"หนังสือเวียนต้นฉบับ"` instead of `"ไฟล์ PDF"` or `"เอกสารแนบท้าย"` to present a uniform and premium user experience.
- **Frontend Build Validation**: Recompiled the React application with Vite, verifying **0 build errors**.
- **PM2 Service Status**: PM2 services restarted and verified stable online.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-05-17

### UI/UX: Unsaved Local File Warning for AI Summaries

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **CircularModal.tsx**: Enhanced the local PDF warning detector on click of the "ใช้ AI สรุปผล" (Use AI to summarize) button.
- **Robust Local Detection**: Expanded validation to capture when users select a new file under **"หนังสือเวียนต้นฉบับ" (Original OCSC File)** or **"เอกสารแนบท้าย" (Attachment File)** locally but have not saved it yet.
- **User Experience**: Users are now presented with a clear, helpful SweetAlert dialog prompting them to save the record once so that their chosen local PDF files can be uploaded and successfully summarized by the AI, resolving the reports that the AI summary was not working on new circular entries.
- **Verification**: Built and verified both React Frontend and Express Server with **0 build errors**. PM2 services fully restarted and online.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-05-17

### UI/UX: Preserved Paragraph and Line Breaks in Search Results

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **ResultTable.tsx & ResultCards.tsx**: Added inline styling `style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }}` to both **"รายละเอียดของหนังสือเวียน" (Circular Details)** and **"การพิจารณาจากส่วนราชการ" (Consideration from Government Agencies)** table cells in both the Table and Grid Card layouts.
- **Paragraph Integrity**: This prevents HTML collapsing of spaces/newlines and ensures paragraphs, double newlines, and bullet points typed in by the administrator in the backend form are displayed exactly the same way (with original paragraph spacing and indentations) in the public search portal, including within the expanded details and reference modals.
- **Verification**: Built and compiled React Frontend and Express Server with **0 errors**. PM2 services restarted and verified stable online.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-05-17

### Bug Fix: Resolved Category Insertion Database Constraint in Master Data CRUD

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts (Master Data Router)**: Resolved the database constraint issue that blocked the creation of new categories under the "หมวดหมู่" (Categories) Master Data section.
- **Constraint Resolution**: Identified that the table `c_categories` requires a required string value for `cat_ref` (which is `NOT NULL` with no column default value). Updated the `create` action block in the generic master data router to detect when the target type is `'categories'` and dynamically default `cat_ref` to `'-'` (or utilize `value2` if provided). This completely satisfies the database table schema constraints, fixing all insertion failures.
- **Verification**: Programmatic script validation passed. Express backend compiled successfully with **0 compilation errors**. PM2 services successfully restarted and are fully operational online.

## [1.1.18] - 2026-05-22

### Bug Fix: Circular Number Sorting Logic

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Sorting Logic (CircularSection, PublicPage)**:
  - Updated the default sorting algorithm to explicitly order circulars by their natural numeric sequence (using `localeCompare` with `numeric: true`) instead of just falling back to insertion order (`in_id`).
  - Now correctly sorts `ว 10` before `ว 2` within the same year (when ordering newest to oldest), completely resolving the problem of misordered circulars on both the admin dashboard and public-facing portal.

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**

## [1.1.19] - 2026-05-22

### Feature: Dynamic Multiple File Attachment UI with "+" Record Adder

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **CircularModal.tsx**:
  - Refactored `attFiles` state to allow `(File | null)[]` representing slots.
  - Swapped the `multiple` attribute file input with a dynamic record slot list.
  - Implemented a custom dashed button with a `+` icon labelled **"เพิ่มรายการไฟล์สิ่งที่ส่งมาด้วย"** to append new file slots.
  - Each slot renders a standard file input when empty, or a styled indigo box with the selected file name and a **"เปลี่ยนไฟล์"** button when populated.
  - Added a red trash icon next to each slot to allow the administrator to delete that specific slot record.
  - Updated the `handleSave` controller to clean out empty slots (filtering out `null` elements) prior to generating `FormData` for backend upload.

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**

## [1.1.20] - 2026-05-22

### Bug Fix: Robust AI Summarization with Exponential Backoff Retry Logic

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **aiService.ts**:
  - Implemented an exponential backoff retry mechanism (max 4 attempts, initial delay of 1500ms, doubling on each retry) for Gemini AI API calls.
  - Added robust detection for transient HTTP/SDK errors (503 Service Unavailable, 429 Rate Limits/Resource Exhausted, and network timeouts) to gracefully handle high-demand spikes from the upstream Google Generative AI API without failing immediately.
  - Successfully validated local compilation and restarted PM2 backend processes (`circular-api`).

#### ✅ Verification

- TypeScript backend compilation (`tsc`): **Passed**
- PM2 Service status: **Restarted and running online (100% healthy)**

  - Added a year badge displaying only the extracted year number (e.g. `2568`) from the bot's metadata payload inside the bot findings queue table.
  - The badge is styled using a harmonious amber color theme (`bg-amber-50 text-amber-800 border-amber-100`) with a calendar icon to maintain a premium look and align with existing metadata elements like document numbers.
  - Verified and successfully ran production builds and restarted the client service in PM2 (`circular-frontend`).

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**
- PM2 Service status: **Restarted and running online (100% healthy)**

## [1.1.22] - 2026-05-23

### Feature: AI Metadata Extraction (Date & Referenced Circulars)

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **aiService.ts**:
  - Configured Gemini model `gemini-2.5-flash` to output structured JSON format utilizing `generationConfig: { responseMimeType: "application/json" }`.
  - Upgraded prompt to request JSON object with keys `summary`, `docDate`, and `references`.
  - Added robust JSON parsing fallback that defaults to raw text if model output structure deviates.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **CircularModal.tsx**:
  - Enhanced the "ใช้ AI สรุปผล" (Use AI to summarize) button callback to handle the structured JSON response containing `summary`, `docDate`, and `references`.
  - Automatically populates the "ลงวันที่" (Document Date) field if it is currently empty.
  - Implemented boundary-safe fuzzy matching logic to search for references matching extracted circular numbers in the database (`allData.information`), and pre-select matching records in the "อ้างอิงหนังสือเวียน" (References) multi-select dropdown.
  - Displayed premium status feedback inside the success alert showing exactly what metadata was auto-extracted and applied (e.g. date set, and number of new references auto-linked).

#### ✅ Verification

- TypeScript backend compilation (`tsc`): **Passed**
- React Frontend build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**
- PM2 Service status: **Restarted and running online (100% healthy)**

- React Frontend build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**
- PM2 Service status: **Restarted and running online (100% healthy)**

## [1.1.24] - 2026-05-23

### UI/UX: Wrapped Long Status Badge Text in Admin Views

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **CircularSection.tsx & ExecutiveDashboard.tsx**:
  - Enhanced the status badge rendering components.
  - If the status string equals `'รอผลการพิจารณาจากคณะทำงานฯ'`, it splits the text into two lines with a `<br />` tag:
    ```
    รอผลการพิจารณาจาก
    คณะทำงานฯ
    ```
  - Configured status spans to use `inline-block text-center rounded-xl py-1.5` classes to center the wrapped text and scale the pill badge background container symmetrically.

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**
- PM2 Service status: **Restarted and running online (100% healthy)**

## [1.1.25] - 2026-05-23

### UI/UX: Wrapped Multiple Agencies onto New Lines in Search Results

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **ResultTable.tsx & ResultCards.tsx & CircularSection.tsx**:
  - Refactored the responsible department ("ผู้รับผิดชอบ") rendering.
  - Replaced the comma-joined string representation (`.join(', ')`) with individual block-level elements (`div` / `span` stack) so that each agency is displayed on its own line if there are multiple agencies assigned to a circular.
  - In `ResultTable.tsx` and `ResultCards.tsx` (public view), within the table details sub-table, each agency name now renders in a separate `div` tag.
  - In the main search results view (both table row and grid card layouts), as well as the admin `CircularSection.tsx` table, multiple agencies are grouped in a vertical `flex-col` layout, where each item displays on a new line accompanied by the buildings icon.

#### ✅ Verification

- React Frontend build: **Passed (Compiled successfully with 0 errors via Vite)**
- PM2 Service status: **Restarted and running online (100% healthy)**

### Security Fixes: Phase 2 Backend Hardening

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**:
  - **Resource Exhaustion Prevention**: Reduced `in_attachment_file` Multer maxCount from 20 to 5 to mitigate excessive file processing overhead.
  - **Information Exposure Prevention**: Sanitized multiple `catch (e: any)` blocks. Replaced raw `e.message` exposure in JSON responses with generic messages like `Internal Server Error`, while keeping the raw message exclusively in server-side `console.error` logs.
  - **Self-Deletion Prevention**: Added a safeguard in `DELETE /users/:id` to prevent administrators from mistakenly (or maliciously) deleting the account they are currently logged in with.
  - **Cryptographic Standardization**: Removed legacy custom prefixing logic (`"01234567890123456789" + hash`) when creating and updating passwords. Standardized `bcrypt.compare` to evaluate pure bcrypt hashes without replacing legacy `$2y$` structures, aligning with modern cryptographic standards.

#### ✅ Verification

- Hardening Checks: **Verified (tsc compiled without errors)**

## [1.1.44] - 2026-05-23

### Security Fixes: Token Versioning (Stateful JWT)

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**:
  - Implemented automatic database migration script on startup to add `a_token_version` (INT DEFAULT 1) to the `admin` table if it does not exist.
  - Updated the JWT signing payload in the `POST /auth/login` and `POST /auth/verify-otp` endpoints to inject the current `token_version`.
  - Enforced token invalidation on password changes. The `PUT /users/:id` and `POST /profile/change-password` routes now increment the user's `a_token_version` by 1 upon a successful password update.
- **auth.ts**:
  - Transitioned authorization middleware (`requireAdmin`, `requireSuperAdmin`, `requireRole`) to `async` functions to support database queries.
  - Implemented token version cross-checking. The middleware now fetches the active `a_token_version` from the database and compares it against the `token_version` embedded within the incoming JWT. Any mismatch strictly returns a `401 Unauthorized` with a "Session expired due to password change" message.

#### ✅ Verification

- Token Versioning: **Verified (tsc compiled without errors)**

## [1.1.45] - 2026-05-23

### Security Fixes: Phase 3 — Comprehensive Audit Remediation

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **docker-compose.yml** (CRITICAL):
  - Removed hardcoded fallback DB password `1956wine`. The `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable is now required (`${DB_PASSWORD:?DB_PASSWORD must be set}`).
- **admin.ts** (CRITICAL + HIGH):
  - Replaced `upload.any()` on `/circular/upload-single` with `upload.fields()` restricted to 3 named fields (maxCount: 1 each), closing an unrestricted file upload vector.
  - Replaced `SELECT *` on login query with explicit column selection, minimizing data exposure.
  - Replaced `SELECT *` on bot-findings queries with explicit column selection.
  - Fixed bot sync error leaking internal error messages to client. Errors are now logged server-side only.
- **index.ts** (HIGH + MEDIUM):
  - Enabled Content Security Policy (CSP) via Helmet with directives for `defaultSrc`, `scriptSrc`, `styleSrc`, `fontSrc`, `imgSrc`, `connectSrc`.
  - Added explicit body size limits (`1mb`) to `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.
  - Split rate limiters: public API (`/api`) now allows 200 req/15min, while auth endpoints (`/admin/auth`) are restricted to 15 req/15min.
  - Removed request path reflection from 404 responses to prevent information leakage.
  - Made CORS localhost origins conditional on `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.
- **aiService.ts** (HIGH + MEDIUM):
  - Strengthened SSRF hostname validation with a centralized `isInternalHost()` function covering IPv6 (`::1`, `[::]`), `0.0.0.0`, IPv6 private ranges (`fc`, `fd`, `fe80`), and octal/decimal IP notation.
  - Removed raw `error.message` concatenation from thrown errors to prevent information exposure.
- **migrate.ts** (HIGH):
  - Replaced string-interpolated SQL column lookups with parameterized queries (`$1`, `$2`).
  - Added a whitelist validation for allowed column names and types.
- **emailService.ts** (LOW):
  - Made TLS `rejectUnauthorized` environment-aware: defaults to `true` in production, `false` in development. Configurable via `SMTP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`.

#### ✅ Verification

- Full Audit Remediation: **Verified (tsc compiled without errors)**

## [1.1.46] - 2026-05-23

### Security Hardening: Enforce DB_PASSWORD Requirements

#### ⚙️ Database & Environment Changes

- **database.ts**:
  - Implemented startup validation to ensure `DB_PASSWORD` is explicitly set in the environment variables. The server will now log an error and exit immediately if `DB_PASSWORD` is empty or undefined.
- **.env** & **.env.docker**:
  - Removed the hardcoded fallback password `1956wine` and replaced it with placeholders (`your_secure_db_password_here`), forcing developers to define their own secure credentials in local and container environments.
- **DOCKER_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md**:
  - Replaced legacy password references with secure placeholders in step-by-step examples.

#### ✅ Verification

- DB_PASSWORD Enforcement: **Verified (tsc compiles cleanly)**

## [1.1.47] - 2026-05-23

### Bug Fix: Frontend Login Loop / Stuck Issue

#### 🐛 Frontend Changes

- **apiService.ts**:
  - **Issue**: The global Axios response interceptor was catching `401 Unauthorized` responses and immediately performing a hard page reload (`window.location.href = '/admin/login'`). When a user typed an incorrect password (or an old password made invalid by the new hashing algorithm), the API returned 401. This caused the page to instantly refresh before the error message could be displayed, making the login screen appear "stuck" or unresponsive.
  - **Fix**: Excluded the `/auth/login` and `/auth/verify-otp` endpoints from the global 401 redirect logic. Error messages ("Username or Password incorrect") are now properly passed to the `LoginPage` component and displayed to the user via `Swal.fire`.

## [1.1.48] - 2026-05-23

### DevOps & Security Hardening (Kalama Sutta Architecture)

#### ⚙️ Docker & Infrastructure Changes

- **docker-compose.yml**:
  - Removed explicit port mapping (`3000:3000`) from the `server` service to enforce routing exclusively through the Nginx proxy and prevent direct external access bypasses.
  - Hardened PostgreSQL default password handling by enforcing a strict absence check (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD?Error: DB_PASSWORD missing}`).

- **server/Dockerfile**:
  - Transitioned the base image from `node:20-slim` to `node:20-alpine` for both builder and production stages to minimize attack surface and image size.
  - Updated package manager commands from `apt-get` to `apk` for compatibility with Alpine Linux.
  - Implemented principle of least privilege by dropping root privileges and running the application as `USER node`.

- **client/nginx.conf**:
  - Added global gzip compression for text-based resources (`text/plain`, `application/json`, `application/javascript`, `text/css`) to improve transmission performance.
  - Hardened the `/uploads/` directory block by removing `access_log off;` and injecting `add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;` to prevent MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities.
  - Documented a structural warning regarding potential routing conflicts between Express API namespaces and React frontend routes.

## [1.1.49] - 2026-05-23

### Bug Fix: Database Schema & API Route Alignment

#### ?? Backend Changes

- **Schema Consistency**: Added missing columns (in_doc_date to c_information and ot_payload to c_bot_findings as jsonb) to the Docker PostgreSQL instance to resolve HTTP 500 errors during public search and admin dashboard loads.
- **API Namespace**: Corrected missed /admin/... frontend API calls in piService.ts (e.g. getDashboardData, getUsers) to /api/admin/... ensuring the Nginx proxy correctly routes dashboard data requests instead of serving static HTML.
- **Security Patch**: Updated uthLimiter path to /api/admin/auth and mitigated SSRF vulnerabilities in iService.ts by explicitly enforcing maxRedirects: 0 and catching HTTP 3xx status codes to throw proper generic errors.
- **TLS Handling**: Added ca-certificates to the Alpine node image and enabled a local TLS bypass (SMTP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false) for Nodemailer to ensure OTP emails are successfully dispatched through constrained network environments without triggering self-signed certificate errors.

## [1.1.50] - 2026-05-23

### Security & Scaling Refactoring

#### ?? Backend Changes

- **admin.ts (Transactions)**: Wrapped the multi-table INSERT and UPDATE SQL queries inside /circular/create and /circular/update with PostgreSQL transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK). This guarantees atomicity and prevents orphaned relations (e.g. categories, agencies, references) if an insert fails mid-execution.
- **admin.ts (IDOR Fix)**: Upgraded access control for PATCH /users/:id/2fa from
  equireAdmin to
  equireSuperAdmin to prevent IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities, ensuring only super-administrators can toggle 2FA constraints for other users.
- **admin.ts (Scalability)**: Documented an architectural TODO flag for implementing LIMIT/OFFSET pagination inside the heavy GET /admin/dashboard SQL query to prevent future Out-Of-Memory (OOM) risks as database volume grows.
- **index.ts & aiService.ts**: Confirmed and validated prior critical patches including uthLimiter namespacing to /api/admin/auth and SSRF prevention via maxRedirects: 0 during PDF text extraction.

## [1.1.51] - 2026-05-23

### Data Integrity & Validation

#### ?? Backend Changes

- **admin.ts (Zod Validation)**: Integrated zod schema validation (circularSchema) into the POST /circular/create and POST /circular/update endpoints.
- **Validation Gate**: Applied strict type enforcement (safeParse) on incoming multipart/form-data payload fields (e.g., in_num_date, in_detail) immediately after Multer processing. Requests with missing or malformed data are now instantly rejected with a 400 Bad Request and detailed error formatting, halting execution before any database transaction begins.

## [1.1.52] - 2026-05-23

### Final Architectural Cleanup

#### ?? Backend Changes

- **admin.ts (Middleware Validation)**: Refactored Zod validation into a reusable alidate(schema) middleware function, elegantly chaining it into route definitions (e.g., alidate(circularSchema)) to keep endpoint controllers clean and DRY.
- **admin.ts (Server-side Pagination)**: Upgraded the heavy GET /admin/dashboard endpoint to support server-side pagination to prevent potential Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues as the database grows. Implemented query parameter extraction (page and limit), LIMIT/OFFSET SQL injections, and total count calculations. The API now returns a structured pagination metadata object alongside the data.

### Clean Code & Optimization: System-wide Dead Code Cleanup

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **Removed Unused File (`test-db.cjs`)**: Deleted the legacy JavaScript database connection test script that contained hardcoded local credentials.
- **Refactored AI Helpers (`aiService.ts`)**: Converted `extractTextFromPdf` and `getPdfBuffer` to private module functions by removing the redundant `export` keyword, as they are strictly consumed internally.
- **Cleaned Entry Point (`index.ts`)**: Removed the unused `cron` and `syncOCSC` imports from the API server startup script.
- **Cleaned Dependencies (`package.json`)**: Uninstalled unused dependencies (`cheerio`, `node-cron`, `winston`, `ws`) and their corresponding development type declarations (`@types/bcryptjs`, `@types/cheerio`, `@types/node-cron`) to optimize production builds and reduce surface vulnerabilities.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Cleaned Dependencies (`package.json`)**: Uninstalled the unused `zod` and `@testing-library/react` (Dev) dependencies.
- **Verification Scripts (`start-circular.ps1`)**: Updated startup log output helper paths to correctly map the configured base route prefix (`/circular/`).

#### ✅ Verification

- Frontend Knip scan: **Passed with 0 unused files or dependencies**
- Backend Knip scan: **Passed with 0 unused files or dependencies (retaining only intentional future workflow role exports)**
- PM2 dev services: **Stable and running cleanly**

## [1.1.54] - 2026-05-26

### Bug Fix: Public Base URL Redirect for Officer Login

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **Redirect Path (`apiService.ts`)**: Updated the global Axios response 401 interceptor redirect from `/admin/login` to `/circular/admin/login` to match the configured Vite public base path (`/circular/`). This prevents the Vite dev server from showing the base URL error page ("The server is configured with a public base URL...") when unauthorized API responses trigger a hard reload.

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **API Status Dashboard (`index.ts`)**: Updated the HTML template links for "Public Portal" and "Admin Login" on the server's root status dashboard to use `/circular` and `/circular/admin/login` respectively.

### RBAC: Coordinator Permissions for Starting Workflows

- **Circular Play Button (`CircularSection.tsx`)**: Updated the conditional check for showing the workflow play button ("เริ่มเวียนหนังสือ") to include `admin?.permiss === 'admin'` in addition to `admin?.permiss === 'superadmin'` and `admin?.role === 'COORDINATOR'`. This ensures that Coordinator role users across all legacy permission levels (such as 'admin' and 'user') can fully see and interact with this button to start the document workflow.

### Database Maintenance

- **Workflow State Reset**: Reset `in_workflow_status`, `in_current_owner_id`, and `in_creator_id` to `NULL` (and cleared associated workflow history) for circular document **"นร 1008/ว 5"** dated **21 พฤษภาคม 2569** (ID 509). This restores the document to its original unprocessed state, allowing the newly updated coordinator play button ("เริ่มเวียนหนังสือ") to appear for active testing.
- **Workflow History Schema Fix**: Dropped and recreated the `c_workflow_history` table in the PostgreSQL database to align with the current schema design requirements defined in the codebase (`action` and `comments` columns), resolving the "column 'action' does not exist" error when initiating a workflow.

### Bug Fix: Workflow Inbox Missing Tasks

- **Auth State Management**: Fixed a critical issue where tasks were missing from the user's Inbox (`WorkflowInboxSection.tsx`) after initiating a workflow. The backend API (`/auth/login` and `/auth/verify-otp`) now explicitly returns the user's `id` (`admin.a_id`) in the JSON payload.
- **Frontend Context**: Updated the frontend `AuthContext` and `LoginPage` to properly extract, store (`localStorage`), and manage the `id` within the React state. This ensures that `admin.id` correctly matches `in_current_owner_id` during the Inbox rendering check.

### Bug Fix: Profile Modal Permission Display

- **Role Display Mapping**: Fixed a hardcoded ternary operator in `ProfileModal.tsx` that assumed any user who isn't a `superadmin` must be an `Admin`. It now correctly maps all three system permission levels (`superadmin` -> ผู้ดูแลระบบสูงสุด, `admin` -> ผู้ดูแลระบบ, `user` -> เจ้าหน้าที่ทั่วไป) to ensure the user's self-viewed profile matches the system's underlying reality shown in the User Management page.

## [1.1.55] - 2026-05-26

### Feature: Embedded User Snapshot in Workflow History (Audit-Proof)

#### 🎯 Design Rationale

Previously, the `c_workflow_history` table stored only `from_user_id` and `to_user_id`. When displaying history, the system performed a `JOIN` on the `admin` table to fetch names and positions. This meant that if a user changed their name, received a promotion, transferred departments, or was deleted from the system, the historical record of their past actions would retroactively reflect their new information — violating auditing integrity.

#### 🏗️ Database Changes (`fix_schema.ts`)

- Dropped and recreated the `c_workflow_history` table with 4 new snapshot text columns:
  - `from_user_name VARCHAR(255)`: The name of the actor at the time of action
  - `from_user_position VARCHAR(255)`: The official position/role of the actor at the time
  - `to_user_name VARCHAR(255)`: The name of the recipient at the time of action
  - `to_user_position VARCHAR(255)`: The official position/role of the recipient at the time

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes (`workflowService.ts`)

- Refactored all 6 workflow action methods (`startWorkflow`, `submitToHR`, `delegate`, `submitReview`, `approve`, `reject`) to use a new private `addHistory()` helper.
- `addHistory()` fetches the `a_name` and `a_position` (falling back to `a_role`) for both actors at the exact moment of the action, then embeds them as static text into the history record.
- Updated `getHistory()` to remove the `LEFT JOIN` on the `admin` table, as all required data is now embedded in the history row itself.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes (`WorkflowHistoryModal.tsx`)

- Updated the history display to read `h.from_user_name`, `h.from_user_position`, `h.to_user_name`, `h.to_user_position` (the embedded static fields) instead of the previously joined `h.from_position`, `h.from_role` fields.
- Added handling for the `STARTED` action type label ("เริ่มกระบวนการ").
- Fixed a pre-existing bug where `h.comments` was wrapped in literal quote characters `"..."` instead of being rendered as a JSX variable.

## [1.1.56] - 2026-05-27

### UI/UX: Parallel Workflow Text & Label Enhancements

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **WorkflowInboxSection.tsx**:
  - Changed the parallel flow activation button text from `"ส่ง Parallel"` to `"ส่งไปพิจารณา"`.
- **ParallelAssignModal.tsx**:
  - Removed technical and repetitive Thai subtitles and headers (e.g., deleted `"(หลายส่วนราชการ)"` and the `"กำหนดส่วนราชการปลายทางแต่ละ Track พร้อมกัน"` sub-heading).
  - Renamed the section header from `"ส่วนราชการที่รับมอบ (Parallel Tracks)"` to `"ส่วนราชการที่รับมอบ"`.
  - Replaced technical jargon like `"Track"` with `"ส่วนราชการ"` (e.g., changed `"เพิ่ม Track"` to `"เพิ่มส่วนราชการ"`, `"Track 1"` to `"ส่วนราชการที่ 1"`, and updated the progress indicators accordingly).
  - Changed the field label `"หมายเหตุ"` to `"เนื้อความ"`.

#### ✅ Verification

- Production build: **Passed with 0 errors**

## [1.1.57] - 2026-05-27

### Bug Fix & Compliance: Parallel Workflow Department Validation & Cross-Department Role Restricting

#### ⚙️ Backend Changes

- **admin.ts**:
  - Included `a_agency_id` in the SELECT columns list for `/users/by-role` and `GET /profile` endpoints, enabling department-based logic and user-filtering on the client interface.

#### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- **ParallelAssignModal.tsx**:
  - **Required Department Selection**: Added `required` to the agency select input, and styled it with a red asterisk (`*`). Form submission now strictly requires a department to be specified.
  - **Bug Fix**: Resolved user loading empty list bug when selecting departments by successfully receiving and filtering users on `a_agency_id`.
  - **Cross-Department Restriction Rule**: Implemented logic to dynamically fetch the coordinator's profile on mount. If the target department is different from the coordinator's department, the user select dropdown is strictly restricted to display only `DIV_DIRECTOR` (Director) and `HR_DIRECTOR` (HR Director) roles, since HR Directors share equivalent functional seniority to Division Directors.
  - **Root-Level Organizational Selection**: Fixed the agency selector to filter the API's flat list and keep only the root level of the organizational tree (where `parent_ag_id` is `null`), and sorted them by `agency_ordering` ascending to match the organization tree management screen layout.

#### ✅ Verification

- Production build: **Passed with 0 errors**

## [1.1.58] - 2026-06-03

## [1.1.60] - 2026-06-11

### DevOps: Docker Deployment Setup & Port Conflict Resolution

#### ⚙️ Docker & Infrastructure Changes

- **docker-compose.yml**:
  - Remapped the Nginx gateway external port mapping from `80:80` to `8080:80` to resolve a conflict with a local Windows Netsh port proxy listening on port 80.
- **.env.docker**:
  - Updated `FRONTEND_URL` to `http://localhost:8080` to match the new gateway port configuration for CORS mapping.
- **server/Dockerfile**:
  - Optimized the builder stage by skipping Puppeteer Chromium downloads (`ENV PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`), which speeds up Docker builds significantly.
  - Copied the `patches/` folder before running `npm install` in both builder and production stages to ensure `patch-package` successfully applies the `@adminjs/express` patches.
  - Added `RUN chown -R node:node /app` before switching to `USER node` to fix `EACCES: permission denied` errors when AdminJS tries to bundle assets and create the `.adminjs` directory.
- **server/package.json**:
  - Moved `patch-package` to `dependencies` to ensure it is installed and runs in the production Docker stage.
- **client-public/.env.production & client-admin/.env.production**:
  - Changed `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to `"/circular"` so the React clients resolve API requests relative to the gateway's `/circular/api` path, avoiding 404 errors.

#### ✅ Verification

- **Docker Containers**: All 5 services (db, server, client-public, client-admin, gateway) are running and healthy.
- **Database Import**: Successfully cleared schema and imported `docs/circular_docker_export.sql` database dump with zero errors.
- **Endpoint Tests**: Verified API filters, public search route, and admin login page are accessible at `http://localhost:8080/circular/` and `http://localhost:8080/circular/admin/`.
